This work, which creates a world in the form of unreality in a world stained with iron and blood, is often read by veterans, and it is said to be a fragile story that brings tears to their eyes every time they read it. Should we rejoice that the concept of war has become unreal? At the very least, it's a great story.\nThe author, Mr. Foderocco, said, \"I was able to create this work because the former Duce actively protected Roman culture and restored the united people and culture of Rome.
