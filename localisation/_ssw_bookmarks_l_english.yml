 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Five years have passed after the end of the 2nd World War. With the triumph of the Axis Powers, the world has been forever changed. Victorious Axis created their own Reich, Imperium, and Teikoku, while the Allies losing their former glory. US and Soviets fell into chaos, and the British lost their empire. However, the world is beginning to stir once again..."
 SSW_JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After their triumph in the Pacific War, Japan took most of East Asia and the Pacific Islands. Now, their military is aiming to expand their influence across the Pacific, while people beginning to dislike their military under the restored party politics. But if you wish to defend the Kyōeiken, you surely need another war..."
 SSW_ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Italians, fortunately, won the WW2. But their Imperium was only a House of Cards. Their overmilitarized economy collapsed after the war. The division between North and South is growing. Even worse, the relation between Germany is getting worse and worse after the death of Mussolini.\nProblems still keep piling up. Can Double-headed eagle revive again?"
 SSW_MEX_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mexicans are facing challenges. Fortunately, their neutrality saved them from following the same path as America. However, their economy is suffering the depression. The spreading rumor about the connection between Cardenas and criminal organizations is ruining the popularity of the government. \nOppositions, like Synachists and Monarchists, are growing day by day.\nThe crisis is just around the corner. Can Mexico overcome?"
 SSW_UTC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The UTC is a country formed by the three largest corporations of the United States. Harry Bennett brought the three companies together during the chaotic American Civil War and was the first to make the ideology of Corporatocracism known in the United States and the world.\nAfter the end of the American Civil War, the UTC became a country that controls major industrial zones such as Chicago and Detroit. Most of their divisions are now mechanized thanks to the cooperation between the three companies in optimizing the automobile manufacture process. \nHowever, it faces threats from the Federative States of America in the east and the American Freedom League in the west. Unless Ford, GM, and Chrysler work together, it will be difficult to survive the chaos of America."
 SSW_CRO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Croatia was founded as a puppet state of Germany in the last war. Although it was forced to surrender its eastern part to Serbia by the then German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, it barely managed to maintain its independence until today. Now that the sovereign nation of Germany is on the verge of collapse, Croatia's fate is becoming uncertain and unpredictable."
 SSW_BUL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Bulgaria was able to acquire the Macedonian region as the result of the victorious last war. However, the country is still unstable due to conflicting ideologies, problems that have been left unresolved, and its location in the Balkans, and there are still sparks of conflict with neighboring countries. We have to solve the piling problems and decide our policy."
 SSW_ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As a member of the Axis powers, Romania fought alongside Germany against the Allies and the Soviets in the last world war and won. However, it lost northern Transylvania to its supposed ally, neighboring Hungary, which still draws its humiliating borders on the globe. In Romania, there is a sense of revenge against Hungary and disappointment in Germany, and it is only a matter of time before this anger turns violent."
 SSW_HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Hungary, as a member of the Axis Powers, fought against the Allied Powers and the Soviet Union and won the war. However, the deterioration of relations with neighboring countries such as Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia after the war strangled Hungary. In Hungary, there are conflicts between the anti-war far-left and the royalists, as well as disappointment with Germany and Italy, and there are fears that this sentiment will be a major blow to the country. "
 SSW_SER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "セルビア・モンテネグロ王国は事実上崩壊したユーゴスラビア王国の流れを継ぐ正当な後継政府である。ユーゴスラビア王国は1940年のイタリアの侵攻に善戦、イタリア軍の準備不足もあって最終的に主権こそ維持したがダルマチア地方など多数領土を喪失、ユーゴスラビア政府がダルマチアを手放したことにクロアチアは猛反発、クロアチア民族主義団体ウスタシャがクロアチアの独立を宣言し、ユーゴスラビアは内戦状態に陥った。この混乱に乗じてブルガリアがマケドニアへ、ハンガリーがヴォイヴォディナへ進駐。これに対してユーゴスラビア政府は何ら有効的な手段を取ることができず、摂政パヴレ・カラジョルジェヴィッチが辞任。第一次世界大戦で武功立てた英雄ペータル・ボヨヴィッチ新摂政に就任した。彼は形骸化したユーゴスラビア王国の国号をセルビア・モンテネグロ王国と改め、国内の立て直しを推進した。ドイツの仲介によりクロアチアとの停戦が実現し停戦ラインが引かれているが、依然としてクロアチアとは緊張状態にあり、1945年のペータル・ボヨヴィッチの死後、摂政職を引き継いだドゥシャン・シモヴィッチの治世下でも同様である。一方でイタリア、クロアチア、ハンガリー、ブルガリアとは対照的に、同じくハンガリーと敵対しセルビアと領土問題を持たないルーマニアとの関係強化が年々進められている。彼らは秘密裏に領土奪回を目的としたハンガリーへの共同侵攻作戦を計画しており、その機会を虎視眈々と狙っている。"
