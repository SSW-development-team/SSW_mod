This sudden decision has been met with protests from the Italian government."

 CRO_german_start_desc:0 "In the Croatian War of Independence, the German Reich brokered a peace treaty. We owe them a debt of gratitude for helping us gain our independence under Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. In order to repay that debt, there is no reason not to maintain a cooperative relationship."
 CRO_german_steal_desc:0 "The only way for our industry to develop is to import steel, which is the foundation of industry."
 CRO_german_luftwaffe_desc:0 "Future wars will also use the skies. We will learn from the Wehrmacht, which dominated the skies of Europe in the last war, and train excellent pilots to protect the skies of Croatia."
 CRO_german_himmler_desc:0 "Himmler is the \"new Führer\" of the German Reich whom we should cooperate with, as he is acting to be loyal in the chaos of Germany after the death of the Führer."
 CRO_german_tomislav_desc:0 "Cooperation means reaching out to others in their time of need. Even if we are inferior to them, we must come directly to Himmler's rescue."

 CRO_german_entente_desc:0 "Croatia for Germany, Germany for Croatia!"
 CRO_german_powerboost_desc:0 "We should not underestimate the fact that in Germany, which won the Great War, authority was centralized in the Führer. The centralization of authority prevents unnecessary political confusion."

 CRO_balkan_start_desc:0 "Since the 19th century, it was not uncommon for ethnic conflicts to appear in the Balkans and turn into warfare. It is necessary to reexamine the interests of each country to avoid being caught up in inadvertent wars after independence."
 CRO_balkan_vojvodina_desc:0 "Vojvodina, which was occupied by Hungary during the War of Independence, is a predominantly Magyar area, but Croatians also live there. We need to determine if they are not unwilling to reside in Hungary, do they want to return to Croatia or not."
 CRO_balkan_hungary_desc:0 "The issue with Hungary in Vojvodina has been resolved. There should now be no reason for hostility between the two countries."
 CRO_balkan_ribbentrop_desc:0 "The current border between Croatia and Serbia is named after German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop as he proposed it. We have accepted it, but it is unclear whether the other side has accepted it. We should use this linear old border to build a strong line of defense."
 CRO_balkan_serbiaban_desc:0 "Croatians and Serbs will never be compatible, which is why they became independent. If there are other ethnic groups mixed in the country, it will create new conflicts. Before that happens, they should return to their homeland."
 CRO_balkan_autonomy_desc:0 "Even though they are of different ethnicities, there is no need to take the Serbs' land and drive them out. Let the Serbs live among themselves for the time being, and we'll add the details of their treatment later."
 CRO_nationalism_start_desc:0 "We have to understand that there is a certain amount of risk involved in depending on other countries. This is also the origin of the reason why our country became independent. Our country should go its own way."
 CRO_nationalism_herzegovina_desc:0 "Currently, our country has no way to deal with an invasion from the sea. It will be possible to deal with this problem by fortificating military facilities in the coastal areas."
 CRO_nationalism_germanrestriction_desc:0 "Capital from other countries may lead to development, but it may also damage national alliances. It is better to keep it manageable."
 CRO_nationalism_italyborderboost_desc:0 "Italy has a history of planning to conquer the Balkans. We must be vigilant to prevent our country from being targeted again."
 CRO_nationalism_vojvodinadefence_desc:0 "Vojvodina is also a multi-ethnic region, so naturally other countries will be watching closely."
 CRO_nationalism_pavelic_desc:0 "There is no doubt in Pavelich being the Hero of Independence, however, his political practice is hard to say necessary for the development of Croatia. We do not need men who blindly believe him."
 CRO_nationalism_coop_desc:0 "The military, as the guardian of the nation, is essential for our country to remain neutral."

 CRO_industrial1_multilingualfacilitation_desc:0 "Although there is more than one language in our country, it is more efficient to assign each language in the factory rather than unifying the languages to save the labor of language learning."
 CRO_industrial1_makeupforpoorindustry_desc:0 "Our industrial production can't even match our neighboring states. We must improve our situation by creating a budget focused on capita investment."
 CRO_industrial1_traditionalindustry_desc:0 "Of course, there are some industries in Croatia that remain from before independence. By guaranteeing their jobs, we encourage the development of manufacturing industries."
 CRO_industrial1_universityofzagreb_desc:0 "You can't survive the winter with just a pen, but you can't have a prosperous spring without one. You can't win a battle with only research, but you can't end a war without research."

 CRO_industrial1_laborobligation_desc:0 "The public needs to understand how critical it is that the production numbers on paper do not match the actual situation."
 CRO_italy_sart_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Italy is the largest country in the Mediterranean. It was its shock to Yugoslavia that led to our independence. Working with them on behalf of Germany, whose Führer's leadership has waned, may help our independence."

 CRO_army_germanequipment2_desc:0 "There is a limit to our country's production capacity. The high German quality firearms will be able to make up for some of the shortage."
 CRO_army_cplang_desc:0 "In wartime, when every second counts, not being able to understand a word is a serious matter. Multilingualism is the enemy in the military."

 CRO_army_researchcoop_desc:0 "The time will soon come when we will not be able to cope with the weapons we have now. The more wisdom we have, the better, as it needs to be updated daily."
 CRO_army_reverseengineering_desc:0 "There is a significant difference in performance between the equipment we got from Germany and the knock-offs we built. If we can't figure out the cause just by looking at them, we have to look inside them one by one."
 CRO_army_tankresearch_desc:0 "Even though our country has only been independent for a short time, we have gathered some knowledge and experience. We are just one step away from winning the evolution of our own country."
 CRO_army_militaryresearchbudget_desc:0 "The military and the government agree that research is a necessary investment. If this is the case, it is imperative to raise enough money to accelerate research."
 CRO_army_ss_desc:0 "The SS that Pavelich called upon is independent of the regular army. It needs to be integrated."
 CRO_army_chetnikmodern_desc:0 "The Chetniks were the organization that dealt with the Red Army of the Partisans. However, their equipment was too old-fashioned to be counted as an immediate force."
 CRO_army_sscroatian_desc:0 "There is a unit in the German Reich that is made up of Croats. We call on them to return home and play an active role in our country."
 CRO_army_militaryacademy_desc:0 "Generals and soldiers alone do not make up an army. There is an urgent need to train people who can take command in the field."
 CRO_airforce_jetresearch_desc:0 "Fighter planes as we know them are already beginning to become obsolete. With the advent of engines with completely new structures, higher, faster, and stronger fighters will dominate the skies."
 CRO_airforce_highaltitudeairplane_desc:0 "It may sound simplistic, but the idea that if the sky is taken, just take even higher has been adopted by the major powers."

 CRO_navy_counterattackdoctrine_desc:0 "If you get shot at, shoot back. The question is, can we do the same thing at sea?"
 CRO_navy_fleetexpansion_desc:0 "Each type of warship has its own role. When the vanguard and rearguard are complete, it can be called a fleet."
