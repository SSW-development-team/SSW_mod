 peasantism_ideology:0 "Peasantism"
 peasantism_ideology_desc:0 "Peasantism is an ideology that advocated the use of agriculture as the foundation of the nation in pre-World War II Japan. The idea of Peasantism is expressed in the short phrase, \"Agriculture is the foundation of the nation. However, after the Meiji Restoration, as a result of the Industrial Revolution (i.e., industrialization), the dismantling of rural society progressed, and peasantism, which aimed at the maintenance and survival of agriculture and rural society, was established to counter this. Therefore, peasantism can be regarded as an ideology and movement with a very modern character, which was established for the first time under the unique historical conditions of modernity, and is strictly different from the peasantism ideology that emerged in feudal society in pre-modern Japan. After the First World War, especially during the rural depression triggered by the Great Depression at the end of the 1920s, the survival of small and medium-sized farmers was at stake in Japan. As a result, a new type of agrarianism with an anti-modernist and system-critical character emerged and developed in conjunction with supranationalism, or national cohesion. The ideas of such figures as Kozaburo Tachibana, who participated in the May 15 Incident by advocating regime change through the unity of soldiers and farmers, and Seikyo Gondo, who aimed to establish rural autonomy, had a great impact on the young officers in the military, many of whom were from small and medium-sized farms, and became an important ideological background for the February 26 Incident.
