 sswmos.2.desc:0 "One morning, sometime after the shocking news of the Führer's death, my ears were filled with news far greater than that. \"A civil war has broken out in the Reich over who will be the next Führer! \" I was so shocked that I felt dizzy as if my brain had been shaken directly, but I kept my composure, knowing that I, as an Aryan, should not be embarrassed in front of my subordinates. The black liquid pouring from the cup that I tilt to hide my agitation brings my head back to normalcy and gives me a sense of acceptance. \"I see, that's why the border guards were rushed back to the mainland.\" It never was an uneventful time of peace since the death of the Führer to this day. The Wehrmacht who was watching over a barn that was more than half-collapsed, and even the SS who was in charge of exterminating rats in the city were rushing to complete the procedures to return to their fatherland and more are still in the queue. It was never unexpected. \"I will go check on the troops still remaining in the Commissariat.\" Left alone in my office, I mutter to myself. \"I sure hope today will be the worst day.\""
