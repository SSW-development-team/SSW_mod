 ssw_Balkan.6.d:0 "Yesterday, [From.GetOldName] embassies in various countries were notified, and at the same time, a press conference was held at the government's official residence. The content of the press conference was the change of the country's name and administrative division, which had been discussed in [From.GetOldName], and it was announced that the country would be renamed [From.GetName] and a new constitution would be promulgated according to the resolution just passed.\nAs a result of various wars, including the Danube War, and diplomatic negotiations, [From.GetOldName] has expanded its territory and become a de facto multi-ethnic state, which has led to the development and resolution of problems in the constitution. [From.GetLeader] will continue to head the government, but since suffrage has been extended to all regions, [From.GetLeader] himself has stated that he does not know how long the current government will last.\nSome political scientists are reluctant to talk about political instability, citing the end of the former multi-ethnic Austro-Hungarian Empire and Yugoslavia, but governments believe that multi-ethnic states can survive if they are not involved in wars, and are congratulating the Danube War on its complete conclusion and the birth of a new state in the Balkans."

 ssw_Balkan.7.d:0 "Yesterday, press corps from various countries were invited by [From.GetLeader] to a press conference held in the capital of [From.GetOldName]. It was announced that [From.GetOldName] will change their name to [From.GetName].\nAfter various warfare, including the Danubian War and Diplomatic negotiations, it was a re-confirmation that [From.GetOldName] became a multinational state. The Press Club continues to cover the unknown aspect of the country as an anarchist state in its various papers, but each reporter speculates that the change in the country's name will not change to the [From.GetLeader] system. \nMany political scientists are reluctant to see the continuation of [From.GetName], citing the end of the former multi-ethnic Austro-Hungarian Empire and Yugoslavia as examples, and governments continue to struggle to deal with the birth of a new state in the Balkans but incompatible ideologies.\nIn any case, there is no doubt that the Danube War has ended and a new order has emerged in the Balkans."
