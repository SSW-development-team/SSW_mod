 sswper.1.title:0 "Start Reformation"
 sswper.1.desc:0 "Mohammad Rezā Shāh Pahlavi has declared that sufficient funds and materials have been gathered to begin the \"White Revolution\" and it has began.\n\nAt the same time, he also declared a suspension of the reform-blocking parliament (which is just the king's statement) until the end of the reforms, and articles of praise and criticism of the king have been flying around the country's media."
 sswper.1.a:0 "God Save the King!"
 sswper.2.title:0 "Resist against the Reform"
 sswper.2.desc:0 "Shah has made certain progress in the reform,\n\nyet there has been an equal outcry from conservatives, who argue that Western-style education neglects Islam, and technocrats, who argue that rapid modernization triggers inflation and a widening gap between rich and poor.\n\nThis problem must be solved for the sake of our reform..."
 sswper.2.a:0 "This is why I suspended the congress"
 sswper.3.title:0 "Return of Davud Monshizadeh"
 sswper.3.desc:0 "Davud Monshizadeh is a professor at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and a former member of the SS, has returned to our country which has deepen its ties with Germany.\n\nAlso, rumors say that there are members from Gestapo amongst the German Technical Delegation, which is suspected to influence Shāh's reform and its opposition."
 sswper.3.a:0 "We can silence the opposition."
 sswper.4.title:0 "Concession to the conservative"
 sswper.4.desc:0 "As the voice of the opposition grows louder, the Shāh has announced he would cooperate with the conservative Islamic leaders and will immediately reopen the parliament. \n\nA coalition with conservatives could silence technocrats who are not pleased with reforms on the economic side, but reforms on the educational side would have to be compromised."
 sswper.4.a:0 "Better then Nothing..."
 sswper.5.title:0 "Concession to the Technocrats"
 sswper.5.desc:0 "As the voice of the opposition grows louder, the Shāh has announced he would cooperate with the liberals and technocrats. Also, he will immediately reopen the parliament. \n\nA coalition with conservatives could silence technocrats who are not pleased with reforms on the education, but reforms on the economy would have to be compromised."
 sswper.5.a:0 "Better then Nothing..."
 sswper.6.title:0 "King of Kings"
 sswper.6.desc:0 "Amidst rising discontent over the reforms and parliamentary suspension, the Shah declared the continuation of reforms and indefinite suspension of parliament.\n\nDemonstrators have been gathering in the streets of Tehran, calling for the abdication of the king. Will the kingdom be able to successfully complete its reforms?"
 sswper.6.a:0 "They should be no parliament that questions the King's word"
 sswper.7.title:0 "Cooperation with the Italian Government"
 sswper.7.desc:0 "As the discontent to the reform is voiced louder and louder, the Shāh has announced he would accelerate the reform by cooperating with the government of Italy.\n\nThe news that a successful developed country will back the reform has eased the public concern, yet the staunch Muslims are critical that it  the cooperation with Christians, neglect them, especially since Italy is the head temple of Christianity."
 sswper.7.a:0 "More Friends the Better"
 sswper.8.title:0 "Deal with the Opposition"
 sswper.8.desc:0 "The reform itself is progressing smoothly, although some concessions have been made. However, the factions of those who have not made concessions are becoming increasingly critical.\n\nWe're getting results and we have allies, so it won't be too much of a problem, but it's something we'll have to deal with."
 sswper.8.a:0 "Tell SAVAK to handle it."
 sswper.9.title:0 "Continue the Reform"
 sswper.9.desc:0 "Our reforms were temporarily halted by the opposition in the parliament, but now the reforms are generally progressing well, in part due to foreign support.\n\nHowever, it is also true that a few opposition factions are still obstructing the reform. If these are not dealt with, the reform will not be successful."
 sswper.9.a:0 "It will be all right"
 sswper.10.title:0 "Compensation"
 sswper.10.desc:0 "Dear Imperial Guard members\n\nWe, the Technical Advisors, have successfully modernized the Empire. Therefore, we have advised the Shah to suspend parliament indefinitely as \"compensation\" and to make us \"advisors\", but unfortunately, he misunderstood our wish and declined to.\n\nBy the way, on a different note, your cooperation has been very helpful in carrying out smart reforms. As a thank you for your help, we have decided to hold a small party on the \"morning the eagle hatches\", please join us.\n\nFrom the German Technical Advisory Group"
 sswper.10.a:0 "A wonderful invitation"
 sswper.11.title:0 "The Morning the Eagle Hatches"
 sswper.11.desc:0 "Shāh... Mohammad Rezā Shāh Pahlavi believed that the reforms he had initiated had been successful and that the prosperity of the empire and the rule of the great king would continue forever.\n\n... But in reality, he is nothing more than a naked king, surrounded in the royal palace betrayed by his royal guards, his only hope.\n\nWe, SUMKA will control this country, and the lone King is a mere doll to us."
 sswper.11.a:0 "Sieg Heil!"
 sswper.12.title:0 "Problem of The Congress"
 sswper.12.desc:0 "The reforms proposed by the Shah were successfully completed with the help of our Pan-Iranianist party and our friends in Italy, but some legislators seem to be calling for the resumption of parliament.\n\nWe as well as the Shah believe that a parliament that only gets in the way is unnecessary, but it seems that some troublesome legislators are gaining support from those who have lost out on the reform. Their influence is negligible, but it wouldn't hurt to deal with them sooner rather than later."
 sswper.12.a:0 "Nip a problem in the bud must be done soon."
 sswper.13.title:0 "White Revolution"
 sswper.13.desc:0 "The Shah today declared the White Revolution (originally a reform plan proposed by the Shah, but renamed the White Revolution when Congress closed) complete.\n\nHowever, the indefinite closure of the parliament and the purge of the opposition by SAVAK led to a rapid reform process.\n\nHowever, the reforms have been so radical that many in the country have argued that they have only added to social and economic distortions, leading to demonstrations in Tehran and fierce criticism of the Shah by Muslim scholars for his sudden secularization.\n\nWas this \"white revolution\" really a success...?"
 sswper.13.a:0 "If the Shah says so..."
 sswper.14.title:0 "The Demonstrators"
 sswper.14.desc:0 "After the declaration of the end of the \"White Revolution\", protesters have been conducting demonstrations around the palace in Tehran.\n\nMost of them are Muslims who are against secularization, but rumor has it that the infamous Communist Party is leading a group of workers, anxious about the rapid reform, to Tehran. Either if this is true or not, taking no action will only make the situation worse."
 sswper.14.a:0 "I have a bad feeling about this..."
 sswper.15.title:0 "Shots are fired"
 sswper.15.desc:0 "Today was the worst day... well, provisionally the worst day, for the empire.\n\nFed up with the protesters who gathered in front of the palace every day to protest, the Shah gave the order to open fire on the demonstrators and remove them immediately...\n\nThe order was carried out immediately, leaving only a red pond and a ringing in the ears in front of the royal palace.\n\nShah was very pleased that the protesters were gone, but this smile would soon fade..."
 sswper.15.a:0 "We'll need to gather only trusted troops..."
 sswper.16.title:0 "Collapse"
 sswper.16.desc:0 "The last shooting at the protesters was reported by the national media, and the people, who clearly felt threatened, cooperated with the anti-establishment faction to protect themselves, while the extremists acted with a clear intent to kill the Shah.\n\nThis morning, some of the SS rebelled and attacked the royal palace, completely destroying the empire that had been linked by the skin of its neck.\n\nThe Shah fled eastward, the Islamic fundamentalists who occupied the capital proclaimed the formation of an Islamic republic, and in the south, oil workers and communists are staging an uprising."
 sswper.16.a:0 "It is the beginning of the end."
 sswper.17.title:0 "Kurdish Uprising"
 sswper.17.desc:0 "Since the Kurds were separated in ancient times, the Kurds in western Iran have been persecuted as a minority.\n\nHowever, due to the chaos in the country, most of the Persian garrisons have left to the eastern front.\n\nSeeing this as an opportunity for Kurdistan's independence, Qazi Muhammad gathered Kurds at home and abroad to revolt.\n\nThis revolt was so large that it has even impacted Turkey and Iraq."
 sswper.17.a:0 "Those pesky Kurds..."
 sswper.18.title:0 "Iranian Civil War"
 sswper.18.desc:0 "The Shah's attempt at reform in Iran has apparently failed.\n\nCurrently, Iran is in the midst of a civil war between monarchists, Islamic fundamentalists, communists, and Kurds.\n\nThe civil war in Iran, one of the largest and most oil-producing countries in the Middle East, will have an impact on the price of oil around the world."
 sswper.18.a:0 "Does anybody know how much reserve of oil we have?"
 sswper.19.title:0 "The Bahrain Problem"
 sswper.19.desc:0 "Bahrain was once a territory of the Safavid dynasty, and as a result, the Muslim population on the island is predominantly Shia.\n\nIt is currently one of the emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates, but if we instigate it, we could easily get the island to leave the Union."
 sswper.19.a:0 "That island is ours!"
 sswper.20.title:0 "Secession of Bahrain"
 sswper.20.desc:0 "Our special forces and the agitated citizens got things done promptly and smoothly.\n\nThe Emir of Bahrain, Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, was captured, and representatives of the citizens declared Bahrain's secession from the union and integration with Iran.\n\nThe central government of the United Arab Emirates has expressed utter disgrace, but their protests will be of no consequence."
 sswper.20.a:0 "It used to belong to us after all."
